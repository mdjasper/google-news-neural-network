		<p>A dataset was build containing news headlines and summaries of the <a href="http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/holdings?t=SPY">top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P 500</a> ticker symbols from Google News ranging from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Oct 2015, as well as stock price changes for these symbols and dates. This dataset contains nearly 2700 day/symbol records &mdash; or 567,912 words.</p>

		<h3 class="code__title">Corpus Sample</h3>
		<pre>
"-K-LDX-ahbYGeGA8QIID" : {
	"bodies" : [ "No companies have done this better over the past decade than JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The chart below illustrates thisÂ ...", ...],
	"date" : "7/30/2015",
	"headlines" : [ "Buy Bank Stocks Like a Boss", ...],
	"symbol" : "WFC"
}</pre>

		<p>Using a <a href="http://www.vikparuchuri.com/blog/natural-language-processing-tutorial/#bag-of-words-model">Bag-of-words</a> NLP model, features were extracted from the data, and a data-set created of text features and price changes for each stock &amp; date.</p>
		<p>A neural network was created using <a href="http://pybrain.org/docs/index.html">PyBrain</a> and trained on a sample from this data set.</p>

		<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> is used to run a web-scraper with asynchronous web requests to fetch the news data from <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and save it to <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> (Cloud Database). It is also used to extract features from the corpus, and create a Bag-of-Words data-set based on the features.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural">Natural</a> is a Natural Language Processing toolkit for Node.js. It is used to tokenize and stem the corpus.</p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is used to create and train a neural network model using and random sample of < 50% of the data-set.</p>
		
		<p><a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a> is a Machine Learning framework that is used to create a train the prediction neural network</p>
